Here we extend an important lowRISC submodule, for use in our [lowRISC extension](https://github.com/MaddieBurbage/lowrisc-extended). 
Like the nexys4_ddr submodule within, this fork allows us to implement lowRISC with our accelerators included, and to modify which
parts of the Nexys A7 board will be used.
